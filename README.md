# Scientific_Presentation
In this assignment, I rewrote a manuscript based on two papers I had read from scratch as if I was the original author who wrote it.

The mentioned papers are:
+ The famous **ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks** by Krizhevsky et al. [link](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)
+ **Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks** by Kanazawa et al.[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5104)
